VR based application which helps visualize the complete building virtually at an early 
stage, which can help in cost estimation, planning and completion of the building in
time with the help of blueprint and measurement. We can also customize the colour of
the walls and can design the interior area of the room with things like (chair, table, 
TV, cupboard and also the industrial materials).

We propose a VR application using Blender and Unity for immersive early-stage building
visualization. Architects, engineers, and clients can explore virtual models from 
blueprints, customize interiors, and interact with designs in real-time. This enhances 
collaboration, improves cost estimation and planning, and ensures timely project
completion while avoiding budget overruns.
